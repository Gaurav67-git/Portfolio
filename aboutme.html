        <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hello! My name is "Gaurav Dwivedi", and I am a passionate and detail-oriented "Web Developer". My journey into the world of technology started with a simple curiosity about how websites are built, and over time it grew into a strong commitment to creating digital experiences that are modern, responsive, and user-friendly.</p></div>

<div class="aboutme">
    <p>I specialize in both "frontend and backend development", which allows me to build complete solutions that balance functionality with design. On the "frontend", I enjoy working with technologies like "HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React" to design clean, interactive, and visually appealing interfaces. On the "backend", I have experience with "Node.js, Express, and databases (MySQL, MongoDB)"", where I focus on building secure and scalable systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="aboutme">
    <p>One of my key strengths is my ability to "learn quickly and adapt" to new tools and frameworks. The web development field evolves constantly, and I make it a point to stay updated with the latest trends, best practices, and emerging technologies</p></div>

<div class="aboutme">
    <p>Beyond technical expertise, I am deeply passionate about "problem-solving". Whether it’s optimizing a website for performance, improving user experience, or fixing a complex bug, I approach challenges with creativity and persistence.</p></div>

<div class="aboutme"><p>Apart from coding, I love to explore and grow personally. I enjoy "traveling, hiking, camping, and learning new skills", as these activities not only inspire creativity but also teach me resilience and adaptability — qualities that reflect in my professional work as well.</p></div>
<div class="aboutme"><p>My long-term goal is to continue improving as a developer while contributing to meaningful projects that help people and businesses achieve their goals. I believe in writing clean, efficient code and building solutions that are both innovative and impactful.</p>
