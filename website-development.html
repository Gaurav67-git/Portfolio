    <h1>Website Development</h1>
    <p>
      Website development is the process of building, creating, and maintaining websites. 
      It includes aspects such as web design, frontend development, backend development, 
      database management, and website deployment. A well-built website is responsive, 
      user-friendly, and optimized for performance.
